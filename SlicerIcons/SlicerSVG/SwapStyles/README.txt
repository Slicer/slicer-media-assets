Color swapping logic for SWAP STYLES approach is described in ../../README.txt.
This logic is for converting Light Theme Enabled icons in the directory into:

-Light Theme Disabled,
-Dark Theme Enabled, and
-Dark Theme Disabled icons.

Files in the SWAPSTYLES subdirectories are LightThemeEnabled icons that can
be used for creating other theme/state versions.
