Files in the SWAPSTYLES subdirectories are for testing color swapping logic for converting Light Theme Enabled icons in the directory into:

Light Theme Disabled,
Dark Theme Enabled, and
Dark Theme Disabled icons.

They can be tested against the appearance of Dark Theme Enabled icons in
../DarkModeIcons/ subdirs.
