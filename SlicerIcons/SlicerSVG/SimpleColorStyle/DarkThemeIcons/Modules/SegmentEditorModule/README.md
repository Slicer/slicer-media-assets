# Slicer Segment Editor Module Icons

Below is a current snapshot of icons for Slicer's Segment Editor Module. 

To create NEW icons to add to this set, please follow [this simple workflow NOT YET LINKED]. The workflow will refer icon designers to Slicer's [Icon Design Guildelines] and Slicer's [Color Palette] to ensure new icons are visually compatible with Slicer's icons and that they work well in both Dark and Light Themes.

## Icon set symbolics

* **Segmentation colors:** "SegmentationEditorGreen" fill color, "SegmentationAndLabelGridGreen" grid color and SegmentationAndLabelOutlineGreen used here to indicate direct action like draw, paint, erase, seed.
