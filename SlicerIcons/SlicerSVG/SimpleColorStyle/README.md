## SimpleColorStyle versions of Light Theme and Dark Theme icons.

**./LightThemeIcons/** subdirectory contains icons for display on a white Slicer background (#ffffff). 

**./DarkThemeIcons/** subdirectory contains corresponding icons for display on a dark slicer background (#121212). Dark theme icons are generated by swapping 4 colors from the SlicerSimpleColorPalette. 'Global' palette colors are used by both themes, so require no replacement when switching.

Slicer core icons use the **SlicerSimpleColorPalette** . For icon authors who wish to extend this palette, it is recommended that global colors be:

*     effective for both dark and light themes, and 
*     adhere to the basic palette and "link to: design guidelines" [ TODO: provide link when available ]
