## Slicer Icon Color Palettes

This file contains information about the Slicer Icon Palette.

 **SLICER SIMPLE PALETTE (newest addition):** Has a set of only 11 "SWAP" colors that switch between dark and light themes and a limited set of "GLOBAL" colors that are used across themes -- no changes required. Additional global colors can be added by module authors, and should be chosen to have good appearance in any theme.

 **USING THIS PALETTE FOR DARK AND LIGHT THEMES:** Note that ***GLOBAL*** colors will remain the same when the theme is changed between Light and Dark. ***SWAP*** colors come in Light/Dark Theme pairs. These colors are switched in each icon when the theme changes.
