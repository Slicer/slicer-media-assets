## Slicer Icon Color Palettes

This file contains information about the Slicer Icon Palette.

 **SLICER SIMPLE PALETTE (newest addition**) Has a set of only 11 "SWAP" colors that switch between dark and light themes and a limited set of "GLOBAL" colors that are used across themes -- no changes required. Additional global colors can be added by module authors, and should be chosen to have good appearance in any theme.
