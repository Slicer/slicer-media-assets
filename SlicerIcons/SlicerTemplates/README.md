This directory contains template files for creating new Slicer Icons. These svg files can be used in the vector design software of choice. 

<!--- please provide a link to design guidelines, palette files and templates, and Material Symbols Icons + config -->

To create NEW icons to add to this set, please see the following resources:

* the workflow and design guidelines in Slicer's [Icon Design Guildelines]

* Slicer templates: [24x24IconTemplate] , [48x48IconTemplate] and [Icon documentation Template]
